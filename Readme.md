# DualFeat: A Dual-Layer Feature Extraction Framework for circRNA–miRNA Interaction Prediction

## Introduction

**DualFeat** is a computational framework designed to predict circRNA–miRNA interactions (CMIs). The method integrates **multi-source biological information** (sequence features, disease associations, and known interaction networks) and applies a **dual-layer feature extraction strategy** for improved predictive performance.

Key components include:

* **Multi-source heterogeneous similarity construction**
* **Node2vec** for shallow network embedding
* **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)** for deep structural feature learning
* **CatBoost** for late fusion across multi-source features

DualFeat achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of AUC, AUPR, ACC, and F1-score, and case studies confirm the biological reliability of its predictions.
